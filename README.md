# speech-recognition-fcs
This repository is intended for speech recognition project. It covers from building speech corpus from audio files of desired language to creation of deep learning model and improving of speech corpus using WaveGAN.

# Building Speech Recognition Corpus
Use audio_segmentation.py in 1-Data Gathering & Preparation

# Training CNN Model
Use the files in 2-Data Preprocessing & CNN Training

# Improving CNN Model using additional data from WaveGAN
Use WaveGAN to train and generate audio from your speech corpus.Use files in 3-Data Generation using GAN & CNN Training
